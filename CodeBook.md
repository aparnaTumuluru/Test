The purpose of this project is to clean the data set.

execution Steps:
Extract activity and feature details
Filter for only features containing mean or STD
Extract training and test details for these features
merge the Test and training data
Add activity labels and Feature names
group the data according to Subjects, Activities and Features.
Mean the values.
